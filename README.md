## Getting Started

First, run the development server:
`yarn dev`

Open [subsocial-test.vercel.app](https://subsocial-test.vercel.app/) to see the result, please don't save tweets very frequent, 1 tweet = 1 min, because your app crashed with problem: *priority is too low: (579 vs 579)*

If you want to run app locally, you have to ask me about changes in the twitter dev portal

You are awesome, enjoy!
